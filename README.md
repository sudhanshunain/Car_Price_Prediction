## Project Overview

This project aims to predict car prices using a dataset of 6000 data points. We implemented and compared two machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization. The R² score was improved from 69% to 91% through careful feature engineering and model tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 6000 data points, each representing a car with various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The target variable is the car price.

## Models Used

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**

## Results

Through iterative training and optimization, the R² score of our models was improved from an initial 69% to a final 92%. This significant improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of feature engineering and model selection.
